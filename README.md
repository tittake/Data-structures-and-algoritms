# Data-structures-and-algorithms#

This remote contains my project for the course "data structures and algorithms". From the files, datastructures.cc was made by me and the others were part of a base code given. Prg2 is a continuation to prg1. The task involves a mapping application aimed for hikers to use. In the first task we added places and areas on the map, and the aim was to concentrate on making those functions as effective as possible. The second part was more algorithm-heavy, and the task was to find routes between places (for example, shortest route, least crossroads etc.).
